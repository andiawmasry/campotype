Garuda STD typeface, originally featuring the shape and style based on “Garuda Pancasila”, the state symbol of the Republic of Indonesia. Garuda is a mythical bird in the Javanese puppet stories, is very similar to the eagle. The first free version (1.01) of Garuda std (designed 2012) has been published on Myfonts[dot]com until now.
Garuda Standard family only has single weight. GarudaSTD originally prepared in the form of an oblique to give the impression of sporty style.
The typeface has a pretty good readability and legibility even in small sizes.  Its sporty appearance useful for short texts for print and screen material. Usage on headlines, posters, titles, or something like that.
